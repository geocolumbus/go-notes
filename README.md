# GO Notes

George's notes for learning the GO programming language.

## Usage

For Mac

```
brew install go
```

download the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/geocolumbus/go-notes.git
cd go-notes
```

install dependencies (humanize lets you display numbers with commas in them!)

```
go get github.com/dustin/go-humanize
```

run it from the command line

```go run main.go```


## What does it do

```main.go``` calls ```basics/basics.go``` and runs sample code that demonstrates types and control structures. I will add more features as I explore the language.
